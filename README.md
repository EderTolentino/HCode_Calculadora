# HCode_Calculadora

CALCULADORA

Project made in the CURSO COMPLETO COM 6 PROJETOS REAIS by HCode, on Udemy's platform. It was very useful to learn a little about the use of Classes and Constructors in JavaScript.

This project was very interesting and very rich to learn several commands that I had never seen before like: add keyboard events, associate specific keys to each function, add sound event to each click, clean the last input value, give the result of an account when starting the typing of a third operation, among others.

It's a project I intend to redo, as I think I did it at an early point in my learning and I think it has a lot of features that I haven't fixed as I'd like.
